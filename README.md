# Demystifying custom Machine Learning Algorithms with SageMaker


üößüìù *Blog Post Project* - *WIP* 


If you‚Äôre in the game of productionizing Data Science algorithms, you must have certainly heard of SageMaker and what a powerful game-changing tool it is for Data Scientists.

There are two different levels to using SageMaker:

* [Built-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html) on-the-shelf models provided to you by SageMaker which are simple to use.
You don't have to have a deep understanding of what happens behind the scenes because SageMaker does most of the heavy lifting for you !
If you're looking to try one of the models on the list, it's quick and efficient.

* If you can't find what you're looking for on the shelf or face a hard limitation of a pre-built algorithm, you must get a deeper understanding of the way SageMaker works to do some heaving lifting of your own.
SageMaker remains an extremely powerful tool of this kind of use-cases!
It's not that hard to take your relationship with SageMaker to the next, it just requires a basic knowledge of skills, complementary to Machine Learning, such as Dockerization and APIs.

- Full costom mode : Follow up notebook `bring_your_own_example_1_sdk/notebooks/bring_your_own_gluonts_mlp.ipynb` to go through the functionnalities
- Built-in examples :  Follow [this](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-python-sdk/1P_kmeans_highlevel/kmeans_mnist.ipynb) notebook example ( listed in this repo under `built_in_example_1_sdk` ), or other examples [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/sagemaker-python-sdk)
